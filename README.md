pomodoro
========

Not your standard backbone TODO app. I needed some backone experience, so I built this. 


I used [grunt-bbb](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb) to easily scaffold modules and develop locally.


You can view a [demo](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/138393/pomodoro/index.html), because of the url that dropbox assigns, 
it kind of messes with the router


To get it running locally with node


1. Clone the repo
2. Install grunt-bbb `npm install -g bbb` 
2. Navigate to the client folder
3. `bbb server` then visit http://localhost:8080
