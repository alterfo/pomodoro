pomodoro
========

Not your standard backbone TODO app.


I used [grunt-bbb](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb) to easily scaffold modules, develop locally and deploy to heroku


You can view a [demo](http://pomodoro.demos.dan.shearmur.co.uk/)


To get it running locally with node


1. Clone the repo
2. Install grunt-bbb `npm install -g bbb` 
2. Navigate to the client folder
3. `bbb server` then visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
